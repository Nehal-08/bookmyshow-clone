# BookMyShow Clone (React)

A responsive BookMyShow clone built with React, allowing users to browse and view movies. This app is designed to simulate a movie ticket booking experience similar to the BookMyShow platform, but without a backend. The frontend makes use of mock data for displaying movie listings, details, and showtimes.
